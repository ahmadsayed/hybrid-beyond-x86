# Build a Hybrid Application beyond x86, using buildah and podman

This article audience mainly Cloud native engineer and architect, with  knowledge to containers and Kubernetes, the following section intented to give brief about ISA and multiarch please skip ahead to section " Options to build multiarch container images" for the technical part.

## Why do we need to consider Multiarch hybrid applications

The simple answer let us put everything on x86 and go with it, the answer to that needs a look at past, present and the futur.

### Past
Enterprises and Large system used to run on Mainframe, a large computer with a large amount of memory, but with increasing Personal Computer (a.k.a) Microcomputer, more CPU started to Mass produced to fit inside a box that lay on the Desktop.

The Microcomputer CPUs started to make their way to Enterprise applications. With the introduction of the distributed system, the x86 machines began to dominate the Enterprise applications with distributed systems' success. Stewart Alsop II famously predicted that the last Mainframe would be unplugged on March 15, 1996. This prediction turns out to be very wrong with IBM introducing IBM Z15 in September 2020. IBM Z and Mainframe turns out to be very much alive and striving. Running a Legacy application very reliable, and the Mainframe is packed with considerable computing power in a small footprint compared to distributed x86_64 systems.

### Present
Public Cloud and Hyperscaler become the new normal for hosting Enterprise application, with apparent domination of x86_64 ISA from Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC. Still, the demands for specialized workloads and hosting from businesses make the public cloud provider introduce different Machines such as IBM power, IBM Z, and Amazon ARM.

### Future Kind of :).
Nowadays, we are in the Era of 5G and IoT, with increased Edge computing demands, and we raise awareness about the environmental impact of the datacenters and increase needs. Power-efficient machines make ARM machines start to get back to the PC market and move toward Servers and Enterprise Applications.

The previous introduction is trying to demonstrate why there is a need for multiarch deployments; if you are building an application, asset, or even custom enterprise solution, you may still face a demand to deploy it on none x86 machines, so what is the other options we have now? before answering that just a quick detour around what is the ISA?

## Introducing Instruction set Architecture (ISA) 
https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/instset.htm

The instruction set, also called ISA (instruction set architecture), is part of a computer that pertains to programming, which is more or less machine language. The instruction set provides commands to the processor to tell it what it needs to do. The instruction set consists of addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers, memory architecture, interrupt and exception handling, and external I/O.

In early 1960, IBM used to have a series of incompatible families, but with the introduction of IBM System 360, the grandparent of IBM Z/Architecture, IBM standardized their Mainframe. IBM System 360 is The	first	true	ISA	designed as a portable hardware-software interface.

## ISA landscape today

Will list some of the CPU, there is many other such as SPARC, RISC, MIPS, .. etc. 
But here, I will list the machines that are easily accessible via owning a device or provided as a self-service on the public Cloud.

### IBM Z  
IBM Z is the latest generation of the System/360 introduced in 1964, currently used in IBM Z Mainframe.
Still, you do not need to purchase an expensive mainframe to try. IBM Cloud introduces Hyper Protect Virtual Server, https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/hyper-protect-virtual-server 
which gives access to IBM Z Machines running Linux One.
* Strengths: Handle Intensive IO operations, such as Credit card swipes.
* Definition in Linux: s390x
* Trivia: In z/architecture, the Z stands to Zero downtime.

### x86
Developed by Intel and currently produced mainly by Intel and AMD, it provides a large family of processors covering a broad spectrum of mobility, laptop, workstation, and High-Performance Servers.
* Strengths: General purpose computing, the defacto standard for all software.
* Definition in Linux: i385, x86_64
* Trivia: Even Intel is the one who created x86, AMD is the one who defines x86_64, the 64-bit extension, after the limited success of IA_64 in the consumer.

### Power ISA
Developed by the AIM alliance, AIM refers to Apple, IBM, and Motorolla, to create RISC machines. PowerPC used to be the standard CPU in Apple products till 2005. PowerPC was the CPU used in many consumer products such as Playstation 3, xbox360, and Nintendo Wii, currently it is part of OpenPower Foundation and is introduced in IBM pSeries servers, also it is available on  IBM public cloud as PAYGO self services virtual servers.[https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/power-systems-virtual-server]
* Strengths: with IBM power 10, IBM claims its main advantage is to provide faster AI inference.
* Definition in Linux: ppc64le, ppc64
* Trivia:  Power2 was the CPU used in Deepblue, the first machine to win chess, Kasparov. Also, Power7 was the CPU behind the machine that won the first Jeopardy.

### ARM
Developed by Acorn computer, to be used in the BBC Microcomputer produced by Acorn Computers,   ARM engineer designed the CPU to be power-efficient. The goal back then is to replace the expensive ceramic package with a plastic package.
To get your hands on a machine running ARM, hold your phone. or get a Raspberry Pi. Also, Amazon EC2 based ARM Graviton. [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-instances-a1-powered-by-arm-based-aws-graviton-processors/]

* Strengths: Power efficiency.
* Definition in Linux: armhf, arm71, aarch64
* Trivia: according to Steve Furber, the principal designer on ARM, when they received the first chip, they tested the power consumption and found it Zero, he reviewed the wiring, thinking that the meter is not connected correctly it turned out they did not connect the CPU to the power supply at all, and it is running only on the power coming from the input signal.

## Options to build multiarch container images

Now it comes to the moment of what should I do make my containerized application run on multiarch, in here will cover four different approaches 

### Options 1: Do nothing it will work 
This the most forward way to think, currently most of the application is written in Architecture agnostic language, Java for example come with slogan compile once run anywhere, also Python, Node.JS, all supported and ported to previous ISA and more.
Bringing this to the container world should as simple as 

```
 podman run -it python python -c 'print("Hello world!")'
```

and this command will run correctly on mostly all commercial Machines, but this only possible because the python image on docker.io itself is multiarch,

when running it, podman will pull the proper image that match you arch and as soon as you build a custom image as simple as 

Creat a dockr file just pulling Python Image
```
FROM python
```

Build and push it 

```
buildah build-using-dockerfile -t ahmadhassan83/simplypy86 
podman push 
```

Then try to run the exact same comman on Arm Machine 


```
 podman run ahmadhassan83/simplypy86 python -c 'print("Hello World")'
```

Will it run or Not ???!!!

The answer is NO, and give the following error 

```
standard_init_linux.go:219: exec user process caused: exec format error
```

It will no longer work on any other different architecture because it is a custom image, pulled and created by default according to the computer you you use.

So with this option we did not do any actual building for container image even the simplest image failed to run.

### Options 2: Build everything on its own dedicated machine

This is a no brainer option, Just simply pick the proper machine may be it sounds like an expensive idea, but still with Cloud offerings, as elaboratoed in the previous section, you can rent a machine in hourly and/or monthly rate for most commonly used CPU such as s390x, aarch64, ppc64el, and x86.

Still picking a dedicated machine for build may add operational complexity, still there is an options to run on emulation on any x86 machine using qemu system. for those who do not know Qemu can emulate most of the CPU in the market, unfortunaty this option may sound attractive still emulating a compelete machine take resources, and still require additional operation, and running a compelete system in emulation will decrease the performance significantily.

To give a sense of the performance impact of emulation find below some numbers I got from benchmarking s390x a machine on emulation vs the machine running on cloud, in this test I ran ubuntu 18.04 on s390x and benchmarked the time needed to executed different tasks.

Notice that Qemu wich is fastest than Hercules still on average ~ 10 to 50 times slower than the machine provided on Cloud.

#### Hercules CPU

    19.429 seconds
```
#### Qemu CPU 

```

    18.163 seconds
CPU: bzip2-compressing 500 MB
    66.803 seconds

    38.001 seconds
```

#### IBM Z Virtual machine on KVM
```
CPU: SHA256-hashing 500 MB
    2.532 seconds
CPU: bzip2-compressing 500 MB
    6.933 seconds

    0.351 seconds
```
### Option 3: Cross Build and Cross compiling
