# Build a Hybrid Application beyond x86, using buildah and podman

Enterprises and Large system used to run on Mainframe, which is a large computer with large amount of memory, but with increasing needs of Personal Computer (a.k.a) Microcomputer, more CPU started to Mass produced to fit inside a box that lay on the Desktop.

The CPU which is initially designed to run Microcomputer started to make their way to Enterprise applications, with the introduction of distributed system, with the success of distributed systems the x86 machines started to dominate the Enterprise applications, till the point it is predicated by that the last Mainframe will be unplugged March 15, 1996, but thyis prediction turns out to be 

## Introducing Instruction set Architecutre (ISA)



## Explore common ISA and the Commercial CPU
## Options to build multiarch container images
## Explain Qemu user emulation
## Testing Enviroment.
   * Kubernetes Cluster on ARM64 using VMware ESXi as Hypervisor
   * Mysql on ARM64 on Arm64 Virtual Machines
   * Single node Kubernetes Cluster and Mysql on x86 VM
## Demo
   * Show how to build a multiarch container image using qemu-user-static
   * Show how mysql replication happen between different different Arch
